# SCT_WD_01
The Task 01 involves creating an interactive navigation menu with the following requirements:

'The menu should change color or style when:
'The user scrolls the page.
'The user hovers over a menu item.
'The navigation menu should have a fixed position, ensuring it remains visible on all pages.


This task emphasizes user experience (UX) and interactivity, requiring implementation with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Techniques such as CSS transitions, JavaScript event listeners (scroll, hover), and CSS position properties (fixed, sticky) will be useful in completing the task.
